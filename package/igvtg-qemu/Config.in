	  QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and
	  virtualizer.

	  When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and
	  programs made for one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a
	  different machine (e.g.  your own PC). By using dynamic
	  translation, it achieves very good performance.

	  When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native
	  performances by executing the guest code directly on the
	  host CPU. QEMU supports virtualization when executing under
	  the Xen hypervisor or using the KVM kernel module in
	  Linux. When using KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86, server and
	  embedded PowerPC, and S390 guests.
